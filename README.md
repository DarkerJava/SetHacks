# SetHacks

Espere is an easy to use web app that leverages the Foursquare Developer API and Google Maps API to allow the user to find shelters, foobanks and clothing donation centres near them. The app is made using Flask and VueJS to attempt to help achieve one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We chose to target SDG#2 and #3 which are Zero Hunger and Good Health/Wellbeing respectively. 

The project was submitted for the SET.Hacks() Hackathon 2020, and was awarded first place within SDG Category 1 (SDG#1 - #4) Basic Human Needs.
